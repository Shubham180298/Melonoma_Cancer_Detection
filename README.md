## General Information
- we have images of 9 types of skin cancers.
- some cancers have more images some have less, so basically class imbalance was there.
- we have to correctly predict skin cancer of type Melonama as if they are not diagnosed early, thay are deadly so can be prevented.

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- since class were imbalanced model was doing overfitting.
- After data augmentation by transforming image accuracy goes down but no overfitting.
- After augmenting 500 images of each class model acheives high accuracy without overfitting.
